# Oral Cancer Detection and Classification

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting and classifying oral cancer levels from images. It leverages a dataset sourced from Kaggle containing information relevant to oral cancer research.

## Setup
1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Kaggle API Credentials:** Set up your Kaggle API credentials by replacing `'your_username'` and `'your_api_key'` in the Python code with your Kaggle username and API key, respectively.

## Usage
1. **Download Dataset:** Run the provided Python script to download the dataset from Kaggle and extract it.

2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset using the loaded Pandas DataFrame. Analyze basic statistics, visualize data distributions, and understand the structure of the dataset.

3. **Model Development:** Utilize machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to develop a model for oral cancer detection and classification.
